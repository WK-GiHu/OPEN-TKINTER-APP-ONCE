# OPEN-TKINTER-APP-ONCE


i Have developed python application with tkinter framework which is working well on windows platform but the challenge am having is that i can open this application several times as it is shown in the image attached.

I want the application to open only once. If the app is opened and the user clicks on the icon on the desktop to open it again it shouldn't open because it is already being opened.

I want to achieve this function as it works in apps like Teamviewer , pycharm and etc.

Your suggestions are welcome to achieve this.
